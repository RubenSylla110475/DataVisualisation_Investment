## Project Overview

In this notebook, you will find the following steps:
- **Data Import & Preparation:**  
  Loading datasets from various sources, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Analysis:**  
  Performing statistical analyses to understand data distributions and identify patterns.
- **Visualization:**  
  Creating informative and interactive plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) that highlight key trends and relationships.
- **Insights & Conclusions:**  
  Discussing observations and drawing meaningful conclusions from the visualized data.

This notebook serves as a practical example for anyone looking to enhance their data visualization skills and extract actionable insights from complex datasets.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   Run the following command in your terminal to start Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
3. **Open the Notebook**
   In the Jupyter interface, locate and open the file Data_Vis_Project (1).ipynb, then run the cells to explore the analysis and visualizations interactively.

This project demonstrates how effective data visualization can transform raw datasets into insightful, decision-driving information. Enjoy exploring the notebook and feel free to adapt its techniques for your own projects!
